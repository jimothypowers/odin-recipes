            <h2>The Perfect Scrabled Eggs</h2>
                <p>Cooking isn't about always doing the right thing, and this summer scramble is a perfect example. Adding juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes to a scramble tastes great, but it's not a common practice since having a pool of liquid under your eggs is considered bad form. I don't care; I have toast. Try to find a goat milk feta cheese for this; it's awesome!
                </p>
                <p>So sit back, relax and follow these easy instructions for the perfect scrambled eggs.
                </p>

                    </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3> 
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water using a fork.</li>
                    <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the eggs, and stir constantly as they cook.</li>
                    <li>Remove the eggs to a plate when they are set, but still moist. Do not over cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are on plate, but these are also good without.</li>
                    </ol>
